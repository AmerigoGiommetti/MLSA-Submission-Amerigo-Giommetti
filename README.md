# ML-Based Python Code Summarization
**Course:** Machine Learning for Software Analysis  
**Academic Year:** 2025/2026  
**Author:** Amerigo Giommetti

## Project Overview
This project implements two different models to automatically generate natural language summaries (docstrings) from Python code snippets. It leverages the **CodeXGLUE** dataset and modern NLP techniques to bridge the gap between source code and human-readable documentation.
The two folder are the repositories for each project one containing a simple encoder-decoder model and the other one containing a transformer model. To check detail for each one refear to the single README files and documentation files present in each repository
